* Some protection for passthrough prompts (e.g. add "Only include a response if it is from the above context, otherwise say...")
* Allow specifying a queryset for an index (e.g. we only want to index Live Wagtail pages)
* Allow customising split size and overlap
* When batch embedding, break large requests in to smaller chunks
